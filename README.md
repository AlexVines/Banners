# Benners placing
* Imagine that international cruise agency Carnival Cruise Line decided to advertise itself with banners. To test whether it is useful, they've decided to start with only 20 places. The task is to find 20 such locations for placement. 
* The agency has offices all around the world. They want to place the banners near the offices so they could easier negotiate and check the result. And also these places should be popular for tourists.
